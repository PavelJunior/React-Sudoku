# React Sudoku

Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. To solve the puzzle
you need to fill all cells. The same single integer may not appear twice in the same row, column, or any of the 
nine 3×3 subregions of the 9×9 playing board. 

You can choose the difficulty, and you have an option 
to highlight all mistakes you made.

Game implemented using React, Typescript and Material UI.
